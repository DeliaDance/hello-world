This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow.
Let's see...I am currently reading a book called Atomic Habits by James Clear which I highly recommend. 
Therefore, I will no longer describe myself as someone who is "not good with computers" nor will I create a goal to master a specific topic. I will instead make small changes in my daily routine to create a framework for developing a system that will help me accomplish what I want to achieve.
