# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow.
I am a student at UCSD majoring in Cognitive Science. Although it's not my career focus, 
I am excited to learn about data science and programming languages. 
In my spare time I like to cook, hike, dance, and spend quality time with my family.
